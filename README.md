## Issues
### TNT Bot offline issue
Why TNT Bot isn't 24/7h online exactly? TNT Bot is 24/7h! But not exactly because it hosted using HeroKu & GitHub not by us! Well we need to pay a host to make our Discord Bot 24/7h online! and we don't have money for that! or even credit card. Well you need to wait to make bot online again, The time you need to wait: 1 week  - 4 weeks!
